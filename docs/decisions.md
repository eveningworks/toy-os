# Decisions

A short, topic-indexed answer to "why does toy-os work this way?" for
the handful of choices that come up again once code has grown around
them. This is a pointer file, not a duplicate of the reasoning --
`README.md`/`apps/README.md` cover architecture, and each entry below
links to the CHANGELOG.md section (or source file) that has the full
writeup. Update the pointer here when a decision changes; don't copy
the reasoning itself out of CHANGELOG.md or a source comment into this
file, or the two will drift.

If you're a Claude session or a contributor and about to ask "wait, why
is this built this way instead of the more obvious way?" -- check here
first before re-litigating it from scratch.

## Widgets are added once a second real caller needs them -- except the checkbox

`apps/widgets.h`'s standing rule (stated in its own top comment) is:
add a new widget primitive only once a second independent hand-rolled
implementation of the same idea turns up, not preemptively. Every
widget through build 480 followed that -- `widget_button` consolidated
three existing button implementations (wm.c's title-bar buttons,
Calculator's grid, Notepad's toolbar), `text_scrollback` and the
scrollbar widgets grew out of apps/terminal.c and were then reused
by apps/notepad.c and apps/editor.c. Build 490's `widget_textfield_*`
kept that pattern (Notepad's fixed filename was the identified real
need). Its `widget_checkbox_*`, though, was added explicitly ahead of
any real caller, by direct user request when asked to choose the
scope -- a deliberate, acknowledged exception to the rule above, not a
change to it: the rule still applies to whatever gets added *next*.
See CHANGELOG.md's **Build 490** for the full writeup.

## `gfx_draw_string()` doesn't clip to a width -- callers that need that do their own

`gfx_draw_string()` (`kernel/drivers/gfx.c`) takes no width parameter at
all -- it draws every character it's given, one `gfx_char_w()` cell at a
time, and only stops at a real newline or the end of the string.
Whatever clipping happens is `gfx_put_pixel()`'s ordinary
screen/window-bounds check, not anything aware of a caller's intended
box. `widget_textfield_draw()` (`apps/widgets.h`/`.c`) used to have a
doc comment claiming text longer than the field was "simply clipped the
same way every other text-drawing call in this codebase already is" --
that was never true, there's no such clipping to inherit, and a long
filename actually drew straight past the field's border into whatever
was next to it (a real user-reported bug, caught from a screenshot).
Fixed by having `widget_textfield_draw()` compute its own visible
character count from `w` and slice `tf->buf` before ever calling
`gfx_draw_string()`, sliding the visible window to keep the cursor in
view while the field is active. The lesson for any *future* widget that
draws text into a fixed box: `gfx_draw_string()` will not save you,
budget the width yourself. See CHANGELOG.md's `[Unreleased]` entry.

## IRQ registration: one handler per line, framework-automatic EOI

`kernel/core/irq.c`'s table (`irq_register_handler()`/`irq_dispatch()`)
deliberately doesn't support multiple handlers chained on one IRQ line
-- every IRQ source this kernel has, or is about to add (a NIC), lives
on its own dedicated line in QEMU's default topology (confirmed by
build 390's `lspci`), so real IRQ-line sharing (which does happen on
busier real hardware) isn't a case that comes up here; registering a
second handler for an IRQ that already has one just replaces it.
`irq_dispatch()` also sends the PIC end-of-interrupt itself,
automatically, after calling whatever handler is registered -- not
left to each handler to remember. A forgotten EOI on a real IRQ line
silently stops all further interrupts on that line, a classic and
nasty-to-debug bug; removing the chance of it was judged worth the
small loss of flexibility (a handler can't EOI early, before doing
slower work). This replaced `isr_dispatch()`'s old hardcoded if/else
chain (timer/keyboard/mouse special-cased, everything else silently
EOI'd and ignored) -- including the timer, which now hands off to
`scheduler_tick()` from inside its own registered handler
(`idt.c`'s `timer_irq_handler()`) rather than a dispatch-level special
case, so every hardware IRQ (32-47) goes through one uniform path. See
`irq.h`'s top comment and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 400** for the full
writeup, including what got regression-tested (timer/scheduler,
keyboard, mouse) since this touched all three.

## Blocking I/O waits: hlt when safe, poll when inside a syscall

Any driver that wants to genuinely block (via `hlt`) until an IRQ
fires -- rather than busy-poll a status register -- has to know
whether it's currently running inside an interrupt handler, because
`int 0x80` is wired as an interrupt gate and clears IF for the whole
syscall, so `hlt` there would park forever with nothing able to wake
it, and naively `sti`-then-blocking would reintroduce a real, already-
documented reentrancy bug: `isr_dispatch()`'s epilogue unconditionally
overwrites a single global resume pointer (`g_next_kernel_rsp`) before
every `iretq`, so a nested interrupt firing mid-syscall corrupts the
outer handler's resume point (this is why `SYS_READ_KEY` abandoned
blocking-with-interrupts-on previously). `idt.h`'s
`isr_in_progress()`/`isr_reset_depth()` (a `g_isr_depth` counter,
incremented/decremented around every `isr_dispatch()` call, force-reset
to 0 at the one safe point -- `process_run_ring3()`'s longjmp-style
resume branch) answers "am I inside an interrupt right now?" so a
driver can genuinely `hlt`-block when it's safe (the common case: boot
init and `apps/` code calling `fs_write()`/`fs_read()` directly from
kernel space) and fall back to bounded polling of the *device's own*
status bit when it isn't (the ring-3 `*_test.c` syscall path) -- the
hardware still raises that bit regardless of the CPU's IF state, so
polling it is still real completion detection, just not CPU-interrupt-
driven. `ata.c`'s `wait_dma_irq()` is the first (and, as of this
writing, only) caller, but the mechanism itself is general-purpose --
any future driver wanting to block inside a syscall-reachable code
path (a NIC's TX/RX ring, say) needs this same check, not a
driver-specific reinvention. See `idt.h`'s doc comments and
CHANGELOG.md's **Build 470** for the full writeup.

## DMA needs PCI Bus Master Enable, not just a programmed descriptor

A PCI device's I/O-mapped DMA control registers (a Bus-Master IDE
controller's BM_CMD/BM_STATUS/BM_PRDT, say) keep accepting reads/
writes and can report a nominal "transfer complete" status even when
the PCI Command register's "Bus Master Enable" bit (config offset
0x04, bit 2) is never set -- without it, the device just never issues
real memory read/write bus cycles, so DMA "succeeds" while moving no
actual data. Easy to miss because nothing about the failure looks like
a failure from software's point of view; only comparing against a
known-good PIO transfer, or tracing the actual bytes moved, exposes
it. `pci_enable_bus_master()` (`pci.c`/`pci.h`) sets it via a
read-modify-write of the Command register, called once from
`ata_init_dma()`. Any future DMA-capable driver (a NIC) needs this same
call before its own DMA moves real data -- noted directly in
`pci.h`'s doc comment, not just here. See CHANGELOG.md's **Build 470**
for how this was root-caused (PIO-vs-DMA comparison, then a host-side
pre-seeded disk image to isolate the read path and trace the bounce
buffer).

## Contiguous memory: linear bitmap scan, not a buddy allocator

`pmm_alloc_contiguous()` (`kernel/core/pmm.c`) finds a run of N
physically contiguous free frames by linearly scanning the same
one-bit-per-frame bitmap `pmm_alloc_frame()` already uses, rather than
reserving a dedicated always-contiguous region at boot, or replacing
the bitmap with a fundamentally different structure (a buddy/
segregated-free-list allocator, the standard answer to "finding
contiguous runs gets slow/fragmented"). A buddy allocator would win if
this got called often against a heavily fragmented pool -- it finds
and frees power-of-two-sized runs without a linear scan -- but nothing
in this kernel calls `pmm_alloc_contiguous()` on a hot path: today it
only exists for a future NIC driver to set up its descriptor ring once
at init, and no allocator changed size class, hot/cold split, or
scan strategy in a way this could regress. Replacing the whole
allocator to solve a fragmentation problem no code in this kernel has
actually hit yet was judged premature; it's flagged in
`docs/roadmap.md` as the fix if that ever changes, not built now. See
`pmm.h`'s top comment and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 410** for the
full writeup, including `pmm_selftest()`'s boot-time verification
(no consumer exists yet to exercise these functions any other way).

## PCI enumeration is a brute-force flat scan, not bridge-aware recursion

`kernel/drivers/pci.c`'s `pci_init()` checks every one of the 256 x 32
x 8 possible bus/device/function combinations directly via legacy
CONFIG_ADDRESS/CONFIG_DATA (0xCF8/0xCFC) port I/O, rather than the
"real OS" approach of scanning bus 0 and recursing into any PCI-to-PCI
bridge's secondary bus. Deliberate: the brute-force version needs no
bridge detection, no recursion, and no cycle safety, and finds the
same devices as the recursive version on any topology this kernel
actually runs on (QEMU's default chipset, or ordinary real hardware
without a deeply nested bridge topology) -- the only real cost is
wasted probe reads on buses/slots nothing lives at, which is cheap.
Also chose legacy CF8/CFC access over the newer memory-mapped ECAM
mechanism, since ECAM needs ACPI/MCFG table parsing just to find its
base address and CF8/CFC is universally supported including by QEMU's
emulated chipset. BARs are decoded (I/O-vs-memory, base address) but
NOT size-probed (the write-0xFFFFFFFF-and-read-back trick) -- that's
deferred to whichever future driver actually needs to map a BAR, since
it means temporarily disabling the device's decode and isn't needed
just to enumerate/identify what's present. See `pci.h`'s top comment
and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 390** for the full writeup -- this was the
first concrete milestone toward the TCP/IP prerequisites README.md's
**Build 380** entry laid out.

## Filesystem is one active backend, not mount points

`kernel/drivers/vfs.c` dispatches every `fs_*` call to a single active
`struct fs_ops` backend (today, always `tfs_ops` -- see
`kernel/include/fs_ops.h`). Adding a second filesystem means writing a
new backend and pointing `fs_init()` at it, not routing different path
prefixes to different backends simultaneously -- nothing needs the
latter yet, and it's meaningfully more code (cross-mount path
resolution, boundary conflicts) for a capability that would sit
unused. See `fs_ops.h`'s top comment and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 304**
for the full reasoning, including what it would take to add mount
points later if that ever changes.

## No recursive delete

`fs_delete()` refuses to delete a non-empty directory outright, rather
than deleting its contents. Deliberate, not a missing feature --
avoids a whole class of "oops, deleted more than I meant to" mistakes
in a filesystem with no trash/undo. See `kernel/include/fs.h` and
`tfs.c`'s top comment ("Honest limitations, not solved here").

## Persistent filesystem is write-through with a single-slot journal

Every mutating call (`touch`/`write`/`mkdir`/`delete`) still writes its
one record to disk immediately (write-through, not batched or lazily
flushed) -- but as of build 480 ("TFS2"), that one record write goes
through a write-ahead log first rather than straight to its final
table slot, closing the "crash mid-write corrupts one record" window
the original ("TFS1") write-through design explicitly accepted. A
single journal slot is enough -- not a general multi-record
transaction log -- because every mutating call here only ever changes
ONE table slot; a real filesystem juggling multi-record transactions
(renaming across directories, say) would need more than this. Chosen
over the two alternatives it was weighed against (a shadow/double-
buffer per record -- simpler logic but doubles every record's on-disk
size; a minimal commit-flag-only journal -- smaller journal but a torn
write loses the newest change instead of recovering it) because it
gives genuine crash recovery, not just torn-write detection, for a
journal region that only costs one extra record's worth of disk space
total (not per-record). See `tfs.c`'s top comment ("Journaling") for
the exact 4-step write-ahead sequence and replay logic, `docs/
tfs2-spec.md` for the on-disk journal format, and CHANGELOG.md's
**Build 480** for the full writeup.

## File timestamps are broken-down local time, not a Unix epoch integer

`fs_stat()`'s `created`/`modified` fields (build 480) are `struct
rtc_time` -- the same hour/minute/second/day/month/year struct
`SYS_GETTIME` and the shell's `time` already return -- not a Unix
epoch integer. This kernel has never needed a civil-date<->epoch
conversion for anything else (no code anywhere computes "days since
1970" or similar), so storing the same struct everything else already
uses avoided adding one just for this feature; a host-side tool
reading a TFS2 image converts to epoch seconds itself if it wants
that instead (`docs/tfs2-spec.md`'s reference reader shows the
equivalent conversion via Python's `datetime`). The tradeoff: no
UTC-offset field is stored alongside a timestamp, so a value only
means what it looks like -- local wall-clock time at whatever
timezone was selected (`timezone` shell command) at the moment it was
written -- not an unambiguous point in time comparable across
different timezone selections. Acceptable for a toy OS's own files;
would need revisiting (probably by finally adding an epoch conversion
helper) if timestamps ever needed to be meaningfully compared against
a real-world reference. See `fs.h`'s `fs_stat()` doc comment,
`tfs.c`'s top comment, and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 480**.

## `kapi.h` is the only header apps/ includes

Introduced when the tree was split into `kernel/core/`, `kernel/drivers/`,
and `apps/` (see CHANGELOG.md's **Milestone 4**) specifically so
drivers could be reshuffled internally without every app needing an
edit -- apps depend on the aggregated capability surface, never on a
driver header or `inb`/`outb` directly. `apps/wm/wm.h` is a second,
parallel boundary for GUI-specific `window_*` helpers, deliberately
not folded into `kapi.h` (not every app is a GUI app). See CLAUDE.md's
"Conventions worth knowing before editing" for the enforcement rule.

## `widgets.h`/`theme.h` stay minimal on purpose

Both only gained their current primitives once a *second* real caller
needed them (see CHANGELOG.md's **"Splitting wm.c into apps/wm/, and a
shared widgets.h/widgets.c module"** for widgets.h's origin, and the
scrollbar-phase builds for how `text_scrollback` grew from
Terminal-only to shared with Notepad). Deliberately not
speculatively built out ahead of a real second caller -- see each
header's own top comment before adding to it.

## The window manager is one event loop, not decoupled components

`apps/wm/` is split into `wm.c`/`wm_input.c`/`wm_render.c` by concern
for *readability*, but shares state through `wm_internal.h`'s
`extern`s rather than hiding it behind accessor functions -- it's
still one tightly-coupled event loop, the same thing `apps/wm.c` was
before the split (CHANGELOG.md's **"Splitting wm.c into apps/wm/..."**),
just spread across files. Deliberate: this is one component's internal
organization, not a boundary between independently-reasoned-about
components the way `kapi.h`/`wm.h` are. See `wm_internal.h`'s top
comment.

## Terminal wraps the real shell, it doesn't reimplement it

`apps/terminal.c` runs the actual `shell_dispatch()` inside a window
via a `vga_sink` redirect, rather than maintaining a second "GUI
shell" command handler that could drift out of sync with the real one.
A short, explicit list of commands that draw straight to the physical
screen or block in ways that don't make sense inside a window (`gui`,
`ring3test`, `elftest`, ...) print an explanation instead of running.
Built across four phases -- see CHANGELOG.md's **Builds 183, 193,
203, 253**.

## `ring3test`/`elftest` still require a reboot after their fault, on purpose

Once process exit/teardown existed (CHANGELOG.md's **Build 173**) so a
crashed *scheduled* ring-3 process doesn't halt the kernel, these two
commands kept requiring a reboot anyway -- not because teardown didn't
reach them, but because they intentionally drop to ring 3 via their
own raw `iretq` instead of `process_run_ring3()`, so there's nowhere
for the kernel to recover them *to*. See `process.h` and
`docs/roadmap.md`.

## `/etc` is one shared `toyos.conf` by default, not a file per setting

`kernel/core/etc_config.c`'s `etc_config_get()`/`etc_config_set()` is a
generic name=value(+`#`comments) reader/writer that takes a `path` on
every call -- it doesn't hardcode one file. `tz.c` and `font_config.c`
both default to `/etc/toyos.conf` (see **Build 357**) rather than each
keeping its own dedicated file (`/etc/timezone`, `/etc/fontsize`,
which is what they used to be, migrated forward automatically the
first time either loads). One shared file was the explicit choice for
today's small, general settings; a setting with enough keys of its own
to be unwieldy sharing it (a GUI app with a dozen preferences) should
pass its own `/etc/<name>.conf` path instead -- nothing in
`etc_config.c` favors one file over many, that choice belongs to each
caller. See `kernel/core/etc_config.c`'s top comment for the file
format itself and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 357** for the full writeup
including the migration logic.

## Esc no longer exits the GUI desktop -- it's unclaimed at the WM level now

**Superseded -- was "Esc always exits the whole GUI desktop," see below
for what changed and why.**

Through **Build 502**, `apps/wm/wm.c`'s event loop checked `key == 27`
(Esc) and unconditionally left the window manager BEFORE routing the
keypress to whichever window was focused -- no GUI app's `on_key`
callback ever saw an Esc press. That hardcoded shortcut is gone: exiting
to the shell is now a discoverable Start menu item ("Exit to shell",
`wm_system_actions[]` in `wm.c`), not a hidden key, and Esc itself is
deliberately left unclaimed at the WM level -- free for a future
per-window or modal use (e.g. canceling a confirm dialog) instead of
double-booking it as "exit everything, no matter what's open or
focused," which is exactly the conflict this entry used to warn about.
See CHANGELOG.md's `[Unreleased]` "Exit to shell" entry.

The original reasoning below is preserved because the underlying fact
(the CLI/GUI editor's exit key had to be F3, not Esc, because of this
same conflict) is still true today -- Esc STILL isn't safe to hand to a
per-window "cancel" handler unless/until something adds its own
WM-level claim on it, which nothing has yet:

`apps/wm/wm.c`'s event loop no longer touches Esc at all -- so no GUI
app's `on_key` callback receives it any differently than before, it's
just not a WM-level exit anymore either. Found the hard way while
wiring the CLI/GUI text editor's exit key to Esc (**Build 377**):
worked fine at the physical console (no WM in that path at all) but
silently could never be received by an editor session running inside
the GUI Terminal, because the old Esc-exits-WM check intercepted it
first. If a future GUI app wants a per-window "cancel this" key today,
it still needs to be something other than Esc until a WM-level Esc
handler (e.g. a confirm dialog's cancel) actually exists -- **Build
377** picked F3 for the editor's exit specifically to sidestep this.
See `wm.c`'s own comment at the old check's former location and
CHANGELOG.md's **Build 377** for the full story.

## Don't put a `text_scrollback` on the stack

`struct text_scrollback` (`widgets.h`) embeds an 8192-cell buffer
(`SCROLLBACK_CAP`) -- around 16KB, the ENTIRE size of the kernel's boot
stack (see `boot.asm`), which is what `shell_main()`'s whole call chain
already runs on (there's no separate kernel stack per "process" the way
ring-3 processes get one). `apps/notepad.c`'s `g_notepad` was already a
static instance for exactly this reason, but **Build 377**'s first pass
at the CLI text editor put a fresh one on the stack inside `editor_run()`
anyway and it silently corrupted nearby memory several calls deep into
`shell_main()` -- no crash, just the font size randomly shrinking and
later keystrokes quietly not registering. Any new caller of
`text_scrollback` (or anything else sized against `SCROLLBACK_CAP`) on a
kernel-context call path needs a static instance, not a local variable.
See `apps/editor.c`'s `g_editor_tb` for the fix and CHANGELOG.md's
**Build 377** for the full story.

## The CLI editor's status bar needs its own line-wrapping pass, not a plain dump-and-let-the-console-wrap

`apps/editor.c`'s `editor_render()` looks like it should be able to get
away with `vga_clear()` + walking the buffer through `vga_putc()` in
order (which already handles wrap/scroll on its own) -- and the first
version of it (**Build 377**) did exactly that. It's wrong for a
full-screen editor specifically because a status bar printed *last*
inherits wherever the console's auto-scroll happened to leave off, not
a fixed row: fine for `console_page()`-style output that's read
top-to-bottom and thrown away, wrong for a status bar meant to stay
pinned to the bottom row the way real nano's (and this editor's own
GUI Terminal renderer, `widget_scrollback_draw()`) does. It also left
the physical console's own blinking cursor (`vga.c`) sitting on a
spurious blank row below the status bar, since that cursor just
follows wherever the last `vga_putc()` call left off.

**Build 379**'s fix -- reserve the last row, do a windowed two-pass
redraw mirroring `widgets.c`'s `scrollback_measure()`/
`widget_scrollback_draw()` (same windowing algorithm, `vga_rows()`/
new `vga_cols()` instead of pixels), and print the status line with NO
trailing `\n` so the physical cursor lands right after it instead of a
row below -- is the general pattern any future full-screen CLI
renderer in this codebase should copy, not another one-off dump. See
`editor.c`'s `editor_render()` top comment and CHANGELOG.md's **Build
379** for the full story, including a padding-math bug the windowing
itself caught during testing.

## Timezone city list is a database file, not a hardcoded array or a config key

`/etc/timezones` (a CSV-style `name,offset_minutes,dst_rule` list,
auto-seeded on first boot) and `/etc/toyos.conf`'s `timezone=<city>`
key are deliberately two different files, not one -- the database
(every city this build knows about) and the selection (which one is
active) change for different reasons and at different rates, so they
went through `etc_config.c`'s generic engine (selection) and a
purpose-built small parser (database) respectively rather than forcing
both into `toyos.conf`. This is also the concrete case **Build 357**'s
"a setting with enough keys of its own gets its own file" escape hatch
was written for -- a city list doesn't fit `key=value` shape at all.
Editing the database only takes effect on the next boot (no live-
reload command yet); see CHANGELOG.md's **Build 367** for the full
writeup and what was verified.

## Build-number scheme: fix/feature/major tiers, not dates or semver

**Superseded -- see the next entry below.** This scheme (`tools/
bump_build.sh <fix|feature|major>`, retired) replaced an earlier
date-plus-same-day-counter scheme (`YYYY.MM.DD.N`), which itself
replaced a hand-bumped `0.1.0`-style semver. It was a deliberately
coarse, Windows-build-number-style approximation (+1/+10/+50) chosen
for being consistent and easy to sanity-check later, over a freeform
number that would be more nuanced but less predictable. Kept here for
the historical reasoning -- every existing `Build N` CHANGELOG.md
heading and `build-N` git tag still refers to this scheme. See
CHANGELOG-archive.md's **Build 110** (the switch itself) and
**Build 121** (the git tag + GitHub Release convention added on top of
it) -- both predate the CHANGELOG.md/CHANGELOG-archive.md split, so
they're in the archive file now, not CHANGELOG.md.

## Versioning: semver + `-dev` suffix, not a per-change build number

Replaced the fix/feature/major build-number scheme above. Requested
directly: bumping (and picking a fix/feature/major tier for)
`BUILD_NUMBER` on every single change, however small, had become
ceremony that didn't earn its keep -- a build number that changes
constantly isn't meaningfully more informative than one that doesn't
change until something's actually ready to call a version. `VERSION`
(repo root) now holds a plain semver-ish string, `0.1.0-dev` to start,
read into `TOYOS_VERSION` by `tools/gen_version.sh` exactly the way
`BUILD_NUMBER` was before. It only changes via `tools/set_version.sh
<version>`, and only for one of two reasons: starting a new dev round
(`0.2.0-dev`) or cutting a real release (`0.2.0`, no `-dev` suffix).
`CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
from its `## [Unreleased]` section forward -- every change gets an
entry there, no version/tier attached, until a release is cut; cutting
one renames that heading to `## [<version>] - <date>` and opens a
fresh `## [Unreleased]` above it (`tools/set_version.sh` does both
steps together). See CHANGELOG.md's `## [Unreleased]` intro (added the
same day this switch happened) for the change itself.

Day-to-day mechanics: `tools/set_version.sh 0.2.0-dev` starts a new dev
round (rewrites `VERSION` only); `tools/set_version.sh 0.2.0` (no
`-dev`) cuts a release (rewrites `VERSION` AND stamps `CHANGELOG.md` as
above). Git tags moved from `build-N` per push to `v<version>` at real
releases only, cut by hand after `set_version.sh`:
```
tools/set_version.sh 0.2.0   # rewrites VERSION, stamps CHANGELOG.md
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin main --tags
```
A GitHub Release (title = `v<version>`, body = that release's
CHANGELOG section, `.iso` attached as a downloadable asset) is a
judgment call per release now rather than tied to a fixed tier, since
there's no tier anymore -- use one when a release feels
milestone-worthy enough that grabbing a working ISO without cloning +
building is worth it: `gh release create v0.2.0 toy-os.iso --title
"v0.2.0" --notes-file <path>`, or the GitHub web UI.

Alongside this, commit messages going forward list each changed/added
file with a one-line note in the body -- a separate, smaller
convention adopted at the same time, not tied to the versioning switch
itself:
```
kernel/drivers/keyboard.c   - added SE layout remap
apps/shell.c                - fixed signed-char gate in shell_read_line()
CHANGELOG.md                 - Unreleased entry
```
Subject line stays a short summary as always; this is just the body,
so a commit is skimmable on GitHub without opening the full diff.
See CLAUDE.md's own bullet on this.

## Socket fds: scaffolding ahead of the driver, not a working transport

`SYS_SOCKET`/`SYS_SEND`/`SYS_RECV` (build 420) exist and are reachable,
but `SYS_SEND`/`SYS_RECV` always return -1 -- there's no NIC driver or
protocol stack for them to move bytes through yet (see README.md's
"Basic TCP/IP networking": PCI enumeration, IRQ registration, and
contiguous memory are done; the driver itself isn't). Building even a
minimal in-kernel loopback transport (two processes exchanging bytes
through a shared buffer, no real network) was considered and
deliberately not taken -- it would prove the syscalls can move data,
but not the actual thing this scaffolding needs to prove: that the fd
namespace, the syscall ABI, and the tagged fd table (`FD_KIND_FILE`/
`FD_KIND_SOCKET` in `syscall.c`) are right, ahead of a real driver
existing. `sockettest` verifies exactly that surface -- fd allocation,
kind separation (`SYS_WRITE`/`SYS_READ` correctly reject a socket fd),
and cleanup -- without pretending a transport exists. See
`syscall_abi.h`'s `SYS_SOCKET` doc comment and CHANGELOG.md's
**Build 420** for the full writeup.

## Nordic keyboard/character support: Latin-1, not UTF-8; 3 remapped keys, not a full layout

Adding Å/Ä/Ö support (build 501) meant three separable choices, made
the same way each time: keep the codebase's existing "1 char = 1 cell
= 1 glyph" assumption intact rather than take on the much bigger
UTF-8 rework it doesn't need yet.

**Encoding: Latin-1/ISO-8859-1 single bytes (Ä=0xC4, Ö=0xD6, Å=0xC5,
ä=0xE4, ö=0xF6, å=0xE5), not UTF-8.** Every byte-buffer boundary in
this kernel (`scrollback_cell`, `fs.h`'s file content, the syscall
ABI's buffer+length `SYS_WRITE`/`SYS_READ`) already assumes one byte
is one character is one glyph cell; UTF-8 would break that assumption
everywhere a multi-byte Nordic letter crossed it, for a codebase that
only needs 6 extra characters right now. `font_ttf.h`'s
`FONT_TTF_EXTRA_COUNT` bakes exactly these 6 glyphs (see
`tools/genttf.py`'s `EXTRA_CHARS`), not the full 0xA0-0xFF Latin-1
Supplement block -- easy to extend later (append to that list and
re-run the script) if more accented characters are ever needed.

**Keyboard layout: `keyboard <us|se>` remaps 3 scancodes, not a
from-scratch Nordic layout.** `keyboard.c`'s `scancode_ascii_se[]`/
`scancode_ascii_shift_se[]` are copies of the US tables with only
scancodes 0x1A/0x27/0x28 (the physical keys under Å/Ä/Ö on a real
Nordic keyboard) changed -- everything else, including AltGr-level
symbols a real Nordic layout also remaps, stays US QWERTY, since this
driver has no AltGr/dead-key handling at all (see keyboard.h's
`IS_NORDIC_CHAR()` comment). Persisted the same way `timezone`/
`fontsize` already are -- a `keyboard_layout=<us|se>` key in
`/etc/toyos.conf`, loaded once at boot by `keyboard_config_init()`.

**The actual bug that made this hard to verify: `char` is signed, and
one gate had a differently-shaped filter the others didn't.** No
`-funsigned-char` in this build's CFLAGS, so a codepoint >= 0x80 is
negative as `char` -- `gfx_draw_char()`'s old `c < 32 || c > 126`
range check and five `key >= 32 && key < 127`-shaped "is this a
printable char" gates across `apps/` (terminal, notepad, widgets
textfield, editor) and `userland/echo.c` all
silently rejected Nordic letters before this build. `keyboard.h`'s new
`IS_PRINTABLE_KEY()` macro (and `font_ttf_glyph_index()` in gfx.c,
which takes the codepoint as `int`/`unsigned char` rather than relying
on `char`'s signedness) fixed all of them at once -- except
`apps/shell.c`'s own `shell_read_line()`, which had a SIXTH,
differently-worded gate (`c < 128`, not `key >= 32 && key < 127`) that
a grep for the other five's exact phrasing missed entirely. Found only
by QMP-testing actual keystrokes end-to-end and noticing the cursor
didn't even advance -- not by code review -- which is the concrete
argument for always verifying a "fixed every instance of X" claim by
testing the behavior, not just re-grepping the pattern you already
fixed. See CHANGELOG.md's **Build 501** for the full writeup.

## Protected files: `device_commit_files` blocks writes, `device_bash` doesn't

`Makefile` and anything under `.github/workflows/*.yml` are protected
specifically against `device_commit_files` -- confirmed for
`.github/workflows/build.yml` when it was first added, likely a
blanket CI-workflow protection rather than something specific to this
repo. The fix isn't "ask the user to copy a file by hand," though:
`device_bash` has ordinary read/write access to the mounted folder and
is NOT blocked from writing `Makefile` directly. So the actual flow is
-- edit the file in the cloud sandbox, verify the build there, deliver
it as `Makefile.new` (any filename that doesn't match the protected
path) via `SendUserFile` + `device_commit_files`, then finish the job
over `device_bash`: `cp Makefile.new Makefile`, `diff` the two to
confirm they're now identical, then move `Makefile.new` into
`_to_delete/` (can't delete it outright, same as any other file over
this bridge -- see the next entry). Same trick for
`build.yml.new`/`.github/workflows/`. Only fall back to asking the
user to copy it themselves if `device_bash` genuinely can't reach the
file. Check `device_commit_files`' response generically for this --
its `rejected` array has the exact path and reason for anything it
refused, so a batch delivery doesn't get assumed to have landed in
full just because the call didn't error outright.

## The device bridge can't delete files, and `git` leaves stale locks behind on it

Two related device-bridge limits, both worked around the same way
(`mv`, not `rm`):

**Can't delete, full stop.** `device_bash`'s `rm`/`rmdir`/`unlink` fail
with "Operation not permitted" on mounted files, and
`device_commit_files` only writes. To remove a now-superseded file
from the user's machine, `mv` it (via `device_bash`) into a
`_to_delete/` subfolder next to it, then tell the user which folder to
delete themselves.

**`git` commands run via `device_bash` leave behind a stale
`.git/index.lock` -- even a read-only `git status`.** Git creates the
lock (to refresh its stat cache, in `status`'s case), then tries to
delete it when the command finishes -- but that delete is the same
blocked `unlink` as above, so it silently fails (you'll see a
`warning: unable to unlink ... Operation not permitted`, but the
command itself still succeeds). The lock file is left sitting in
`.git/`, and the *next* `git` command that needs to write the index
(`add`, `commit`, ...) fails hard with `fatal: Unable to create
'.../index.lock': File exists` -- indistinguishable from a genuinely
stuck git process, and just as confusing if it's the user's own
terminal that hits it after a session leaves one behind. Fix: rename
the lock out of the way instead of deleting it -- `tools/device_git.sh`
does this automatically, both BEFORE running the real git command
(sweeps anything already stale) and AFTER it (sweeps whatever that
command itself just left behind, with a `sleep 0.5` first -- a lock
git just created can be briefly invisible to `find` over this mount
without it, confirmed by testing). Earlier versions of the script only
swept before, which left a fresh lock for the *next* command --
including the user's own terminal -- to trip over; sweeping after too
is what makes the repo actually lock-free when the script returns,
not just when the next `device_git.sh` call happens to run. Always use
`tools/device_git.sh` for every `git` command reached this way,
`status` included -- never hand-roll this check inline, and never run
`git` directly via `device_bash` even for a "harmless" read.

## Button press/release feedback: a general `on_press`/`on_release` WM mechanism, not a Calculator-only hack

Calculator's buttons already used the shared `widget_button()`
(`apps/widgets.c`) -- the actual gap was that nothing in the window
manager ever told an app "the mouse is down and still on this button,"
so no app could draw a pressed state even if it wanted to. Two ways to
close that: give Calculator its own private mouse-tracking (poll
button state directly in `calculator_draw()` somehow), or add a real
event to the window manager's app-callback contract. Went with the
latter -- `gui_apps.h` gained `on_press(win, cx, cy)`/`on_release(win)`,
driven from `apps/wm/wm_input.c`'s `wm_update_drag_resize()` the same
way `content_dragging`/`on_drag` already work, with a matching
`content_pressed` index in `wm_internal.h`. Reasoning: this codebase
already has one precedent for "click vs. hold-and-drag needs its own
event pair distinct from `on_click`" (`on_drag_start`/`on_drag`), and
press/release is exactly that same shape -- a private per-app
workaround would have solved Calculator alone and left the next app
that wants pressed-button feedback (or a held-scrollbar-thumb, or a
press-and-repeat spinner) to reinvent it from scratch. See
`CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]` entry for the mechanism's actual shape
(why it fires on the initial button-down tick, why it returns 1 only
when the "hot" button changes, how drag-off-before-release un-presses
without triggering the button).
