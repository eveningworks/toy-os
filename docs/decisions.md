# Decisions

A short, topic-indexed answer to "why does toy-os work this way?" for
the handful of choices that come up again once code has grown around
them. This is a pointer file, not a duplicate of the reasoning --
`README.md`/`apps/README.md` cover architecture, and each entry below
links to the CHANGELOG.md section (or source file) that has the full
writeup. Update the pointer here when a decision changes; don't copy
the reasoning itself out of CHANGELOG.md or a source comment into this
file, or the two will drift.

If you're a Claude session or a contributor and about to ask "wait, why
is this built this way instead of the more obvious way?" -- check here
first before re-litigating it from scratch.

## Widgets are added once a second real caller needs them -- except the checkbox

`apps/widgets.h`'s standing rule (stated in its own top comment) is:
add a new widget primitive only once a second independent hand-rolled
implementation of the same idea turns up, not preemptively. Every
widget through build 480 followed that -- `widget_button` consolidated
three existing button implementations (wm.c's title-bar buttons,
Calculator's grid, Notepad's toolbar), `text_scrollback` and the
scrollbar widgets grew out of apps/terminal.c and were then reused
by apps/notepad.c and apps/editor.c. Build 490's `widget_textfield_*`
kept that pattern (Notepad's fixed filename was the identified real
need). Its `widget_checkbox_*`, though, was added explicitly ahead of
any real caller, by direct user request when asked to choose the
scope -- a deliberate, acknowledged exception to the rule above, not a
change to it: the rule still applies to whatever gets added *next*.
See CHANGELOG.md's **Build 490** for the full writeup.

## IRQ registration: one handler per line, framework-automatic EOI

`kernel/core/irq.c`'s table (`irq_register_handler()`/`irq_dispatch()`)
deliberately doesn't support multiple handlers chained on one IRQ line
-- every IRQ source this kernel has, or is about to add (a NIC), lives
on its own dedicated line in QEMU's default topology (confirmed by
build 390's `lspci`), so real IRQ-line sharing (which does happen on
busier real hardware) isn't a case that comes up here; registering a
second handler for an IRQ that already has one just replaces it.
`irq_dispatch()` also sends the PIC end-of-interrupt itself,
automatically, after calling whatever handler is registered -- not
left to each handler to remember. A forgotten EOI on a real IRQ line
silently stops all further interrupts on that line, a classic and
nasty-to-debug bug; removing the chance of it was judged worth the
small loss of flexibility (a handler can't EOI early, before doing
slower work). This replaced `isr_dispatch()`'s old hardcoded if/else
chain (timer/keyboard/mouse special-cased, everything else silently
EOI'd and ignored) -- including the timer, which now hands off to
`scheduler_tick()` from inside its own registered handler
(`idt.c`'s `timer_irq_handler()`) rather than a dispatch-level special
case, so every hardware IRQ (32-47) goes through one uniform path. See
`irq.h`'s top comment and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 400** for the full
writeup, including what got regression-tested (timer/scheduler,
keyboard, mouse) since this touched all three.

## Blocking I/O waits: hlt when safe, poll when inside a syscall

Any driver that wants to genuinely block (via `hlt`) until an IRQ
fires -- rather than busy-poll a status register -- has to know
whether it's currently running inside an interrupt handler, because
`int 0x80` is wired as an interrupt gate and clears IF for the whole
syscall, so `hlt` there would park forever with nothing able to wake
it, and naively `sti`-then-blocking would reintroduce a real, already-
documented reentrancy bug: `isr_dispatch()`'s epilogue unconditionally
overwrites a single global resume pointer (`g_next_kernel_rsp`) before
every `iretq`, so a nested interrupt firing mid-syscall corrupts the
outer handler's resume point (this is why `SYS_READ_KEY` abandoned
blocking-with-interrupts-on previously). `idt.h`'s
`isr_in_progress()`/`isr_reset_depth()` (a `g_isr_depth` counter,
incremented/decremented around every `isr_dispatch()` call, force-reset
to 0 at the one safe point -- `process_run_ring3()`'s longjmp-style
resume branch) answers "am I inside an interrupt right now?" so a
driver can genuinely `hlt`-block when it's safe (the common case: boot
init and `apps/` code calling `fs_write()`/`fs_read()` directly from
kernel space) and fall back to bounded polling of the *device's own*
status bit when it isn't (the ring-3 `*_test.c` syscall path) -- the
hardware still raises that bit regardless of the CPU's IF state, so
polling it is still real completion detection, just not CPU-interrupt-
driven. `ata.c`'s `wait_dma_irq()` is the first (and, as of this
writing, only) caller, but the mechanism itself is general-purpose --
any future driver wanting to block inside a syscall-reachable code
path (a NIC's TX/RX ring, say) needs this same check, not a
driver-specific reinvention. See `idt.h`'s doc comments and
CHANGELOG.md's **Build 470** for the full writeup.

## DMA needs PCI Bus Master Enable, not just a programmed descriptor

A PCI device's I/O-mapped DMA control registers (a Bus-Master IDE
controller's BM_CMD/BM_STATUS/BM_PRDT, say) keep accepting reads/
writes and can report a nominal "transfer complete" status even when
the PCI Command register's "Bus Master Enable" bit (config offset
0x04, bit 2) is never set -- without it, the device just never issues
real memory read/write bus cycles, so DMA "succeeds" while moving no
actual data. Easy to miss because nothing about the failure looks like
a failure from software's point of view; only comparing against a
known-good PIO transfer, or tracing the actual bytes moved, exposes
it. `pci_enable_bus_master()` (`pci.c`/`pci.h`) sets it via a
read-modify-write of the Command register, called once from
`ata_init_dma()`. Any future DMA-capable driver (a NIC) needs this same
call before its own DMA moves real data -- noted directly in
`pci.h`'s doc comment, not just here. See CHANGELOG.md's **Build 470**
for how this was root-caused (PIO-vs-DMA comparison, then a host-side
pre-seeded disk image to isolate the read path and trace the bounce
buffer).

## Contiguous memory: linear bitmap scan, not a buddy allocator

`pmm_alloc_contiguous()` (`kernel/core/pmm.c`) finds a run of N
physically contiguous free frames by linearly scanning the same
one-bit-per-frame bitmap `pmm_alloc_frame()` already uses, rather than
reserving a dedicated always-contiguous region at boot, or replacing
the bitmap with a fundamentally different structure (a buddy/
segregated-free-list allocator, the standard answer to "finding
contiguous runs gets slow/fragmented"). A buddy allocator would win if
this got called often against a heavily fragmented pool -- it finds
and frees power-of-two-sized runs without a linear scan -- but nothing
in this kernel calls `pmm_alloc_contiguous()` on a hot path: today it
only exists for a future NIC driver to set up its descriptor ring once
at init, and no allocator changed size class, hot/cold split, or
scan strategy in a way this could regress. Replacing the whole
allocator to solve a fragmentation problem no code in this kernel has
actually hit yet was judged premature; it's flagged in README.md's
**Ideas for what's next** as the fix if that ever changes, not built
now. See `pmm.h`'s top comment and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 410** for the
full writeup, including `pmm_selftest()`'s boot-time verification
(no consumer exists yet to exercise these functions any other way).

## PCI enumeration is a brute-force flat scan, not bridge-aware recursion

`kernel/drivers/pci.c`'s `pci_init()` checks every one of the 256 x 32
x 8 possible bus/device/function combinations directly via legacy
CONFIG_ADDRESS/CONFIG_DATA (0xCF8/0xCFC) port I/O, rather than the
"real OS" approach of scanning bus 0 and recursing into any PCI-to-PCI
bridge's secondary bus. Deliberate: the brute-force version needs no
bridge detection, no recursion, and no cycle safety, and finds the
same devices as the recursive version on any topology this kernel
actually runs on (QEMU's default chipset, or ordinary real hardware
without a deeply nested bridge topology) -- the only real cost is
wasted probe reads on buses/slots nothing lives at, which is cheap.
Also chose legacy CF8/CFC access over the newer memory-mapped ECAM
mechanism, since ECAM needs ACPI/MCFG table parsing just to find its
base address and CF8/CFC is universally supported including by QEMU's
emulated chipset. BARs are decoded (I/O-vs-memory, base address) but
NOT size-probed (the write-0xFFFFFFFF-and-read-back trick) -- that's
deferred to whichever future driver actually needs to map a BAR, since
it means temporarily disabling the device's decode and isn't needed
just to enumerate/identify what's present. See `pci.h`'s top comment
and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 390** for the full writeup -- this was the
first concrete milestone toward the TCP/IP prerequisites README.md's
**Build 380** entry laid out.

## Filesystem is one active backend, not mount points

`kernel/drivers/vfs.c` dispatches every `fs_*` call to a single active
`struct fs_ops` backend (today, always `tfs_ops` -- see
`kernel/include/fs_ops.h`). Adding a second filesystem means writing a
new backend and pointing `fs_init()` at it, not routing different path
prefixes to different backends simultaneously -- nothing needs the
latter yet, and it's meaningfully more code (cross-mount path
resolution, boundary conflicts) for a capability that would sit
unused. See `fs_ops.h`'s top comment and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 304**
for the full reasoning, including what it would take to add mount
points later if that ever changes.

## No recursive delete

`fs_delete()` refuses to delete a non-empty directory outright, rather
than deleting its contents. Deliberate, not a missing feature --
avoids a whole class of "oops, deleted more than I meant to" mistakes
in a filesystem with no trash/undo. See `kernel/include/fs.h` and
`tfs.c`'s top comment ("Honest limitations, not solved here").

## Persistent filesystem is write-through with a single-slot journal

Every mutating call (`touch`/`write`/`mkdir`/`delete`) still writes its
one record to disk immediately (write-through, not batched or lazily
flushed) -- but as of build 480 ("TFS2"), that one record write goes
through a write-ahead log first rather than straight to its final
table slot, closing the "crash mid-write corrupts one record" window
the original ("TFS1") write-through design explicitly accepted. A
single journal slot is enough -- not a general multi-record
transaction log -- because every mutating call here only ever changes
ONE table slot; a real filesystem juggling multi-record transactions
(renaming across directories, say) would need more than this. Chosen
over the two alternatives it was weighed against (a shadow/double-
buffer per record -- simpler logic but doubles every record's on-disk
size; a minimal commit-flag-only journal -- smaller journal but a torn
write loses the newest change instead of recovering it) because it
gives genuine crash recovery, not just torn-write detection, for a
journal region that only costs one extra record's worth of disk space
total (not per-record). See `tfs.c`'s top comment ("Journaling") for
the exact 4-step write-ahead sequence and replay logic, `docs/
tfs2-spec.md` for the on-disk journal format, and CHANGELOG.md's
**Build 480** for the full writeup.

## File timestamps are broken-down local time, not a Unix epoch integer

`fs_stat()`'s `created`/`modified` fields (build 480) are `struct
rtc_time` -- the same hour/minute/second/day/month/year struct
`SYS_GETTIME` and the shell's `time` already return -- not a Unix
epoch integer. This kernel has never needed a civil-date<->epoch
conversion for anything else (no code anywhere computes "days since
1970" or similar), so storing the same struct everything else already
uses avoided adding one just for this feature; a host-side tool
reading a TFS2 image converts to epoch seconds itself if it wants
that instead (`docs/tfs2-spec.md`'s reference reader shows the
equivalent conversion via Python's `datetime`). The tradeoff: no
UTC-offset field is stored alongside a timestamp, so a value only
means what it looks like -- local wall-clock time at whatever
timezone was selected (`timezone` shell command) at the moment it was
written -- not an unambiguous point in time comparable across
different timezone selections. Acceptable for a toy OS's own files;
would need revisiting (probably by finally adding an epoch conversion
helper) if timestamps ever needed to be meaningfully compared against
a real-world reference. See `fs.h`'s `fs_stat()` doc comment,
`tfs.c`'s top comment, and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 480**.

## `kapi.h` is the only header apps/ includes

Introduced when the tree was split into `kernel/core/`, `kernel/drivers/`,
and `apps/` (see CHANGELOG.md's **Milestone 4**) specifically so
drivers could be reshuffled internally without every app needing an
edit -- apps depend on the aggregated capability surface, never on a
driver header or `inb`/`outb` directly. `apps/wm/wm.h` is a second,
parallel boundary for GUI-specific `window_*` helpers, deliberately
not folded into `kapi.h` (not every app is a GUI app). See CLAUDE.md's
"Conventions worth knowing before editing" for the enforcement rule.

## `widgets.h`/`theme.h` stay minimal on purpose

Both only gained their current primitives once a *second* real caller
needed them (see CHANGELOG.md's **"Splitting wm.c into apps/wm/, and a
shared widgets.h/widgets.c module"** for widgets.h's origin, and the
scrollbar-phase builds for how `text_scrollback` grew from
Terminal-only to shared with Notepad). Deliberately not
speculatively built out ahead of a real second caller -- see each
header's own top comment before adding to it.

## The window manager is one event loop, not decoupled components

`apps/wm/` is split into `wm.c`/`wm_input.c`/`wm_render.c` by concern
for *readability*, but shares state through `wm_internal.h`'s
`extern`s rather than hiding it behind accessor functions -- it's
still one tightly-coupled event loop, the same thing `apps/wm.c` was
before the split (CHANGELOG.md's **"Splitting wm.c into apps/wm/..."**),
just spread across files. Deliberate: this is one component's internal
organization, not a boundary between independently-reasoned-about
components the way `kapi.h`/`wm.h` are. See `wm_internal.h`'s top
comment.

## Terminal wraps the real shell, it doesn't reimplement it

`apps/terminal.c` runs the actual `shell_dispatch()` inside a window
via a `vga_sink` redirect, rather than maintaining a second "GUI
shell" command handler that could drift out of sync with the real one.
A short, explicit list of commands that draw straight to the physical
screen or block in ways that don't make sense inside a window (`gui`,
`ring3test`, `elftest`, ...) print an explanation instead of running.
Built across four phases -- see CHANGELOG.md's **Builds 183, 193,
203, 253**.

## `ring3test`/`elftest` still require a reboot after their fault, on purpose

Once process exit/teardown existed (CHANGELOG.md's **Build 173**) so a
crashed *scheduled* ring-3 process doesn't halt the kernel, these two
commands kept requiring a reboot anyway -- not because teardown didn't
reach them, but because they intentionally drop to ring 3 via their
own raw `iretq` instead of `process_run_ring3()`, so there's nowhere
for the kernel to recover them *to*. See `process.h` and README's
"Ideas for what's next".

## `/etc` is one shared `toyos.conf` by default, not a file per setting

`kernel/core/etc_config.c`'s `etc_config_get()`/`etc_config_set()` is a
generic name=value(+`#`comments) reader/writer that takes a `path` on
every call -- it doesn't hardcode one file. `tz.c` and `font_config.c`
both default to `/etc/toyos.conf` (see **Build 357**) rather than each
keeping its own dedicated file (`/etc/timezone`, `/etc/fontsize`,
which is what they used to be, migrated forward automatically the
first time either loads). One shared file was the explicit choice for
today's small, general settings; a setting with enough keys of its own
to be unwieldy sharing it (a GUI app with a dozen preferences) should
pass its own `/etc/<name>.conf` path instead -- nothing in
`etc_config.c` favors one file over many, that choice belongs to each
caller. See `kernel/core/etc_config.c`'s top comment for the file
format itself and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 357** for the full writeup
including the migration logic.

## Esc always exits the whole GUI desktop -- never route an app's "close/cancel" to it

`apps/wm/wm.c`'s event loop checks `key == 27` (Esc) and unconditionally
leaves the window manager BEFORE routing the keypress to whichever
window is focused -- no GUI app's `on_key` callback ever sees an Esc
press, no matter what it's focused on. Found the hard way while wiring
the CLI/GUI text editor's exit key to Esc (**Build 377**): worked fine
at the physical console (no WM in that path at all) but silently could
never be received by an editor session running inside the GUI Terminal.
If a future GUI app wants a per-window "cancel this, don't leave the
desktop" key, it needs to be something other than Esc -- **Build 377**
picked F3 for the editor's exit specifically because it doesn't have
this conflict on either surface. See `wm.c`'s own comment at that check
and CHANGELOG.md's **Build 377** for the full story.

## Don't put a `text_scrollback` on the stack

`struct text_scrollback` (`widgets.h`) embeds an 8192-cell buffer
(`SCROLLBACK_CAP`) -- around 16KB, the ENTIRE size of the kernel's boot
stack (see `boot.asm`), which is what `shell_main()`'s whole call chain
already runs on (there's no separate kernel stack per "process" the way
ring-3 processes get one). `apps/notepad.c`'s `g_notepad` was already a
static instance for exactly this reason, but **Build 377**'s first pass
at the CLI text editor put a fresh one on the stack inside `editor_run()`
anyway and it silently corrupted nearby memory several calls deep into
`shell_main()` -- no crash, just the font size randomly shrinking and
later keystrokes quietly not registering. Any new caller of
`text_scrollback` (or anything else sized against `SCROLLBACK_CAP`) on a
kernel-context call path needs a static instance, not a local variable.
See `apps/editor.c`'s `g_editor_tb` for the fix and CHANGELOG.md's
**Build 377** for the full story.

## The CLI editor's status bar needs its own line-wrapping pass, not a plain dump-and-let-the-console-wrap

`apps/editor.c`'s `editor_render()` looks like it should be able to get
away with `vga_clear()` + walking the buffer through `vga_putc()` in
order (which already handles wrap/scroll on its own) -- and the first
version of it (**Build 377**) did exactly that. It's wrong for a
full-screen editor specifically because a status bar printed *last*
inherits wherever the console's auto-scroll happened to leave off, not
a fixed row: fine for `console_page()`-style output that's read
top-to-bottom and thrown away, wrong for a status bar meant to stay
pinned to the bottom row the way real nano's (and this editor's own
GUI Terminal renderer, `widget_scrollback_draw()`) does. It also left
the physical console's own blinking cursor (`vga.c`) sitting on a
spurious blank row below the status bar, since that cursor just
follows wherever the last `vga_putc()` call left off.

**Build 379**'s fix -- reserve the last row, do a windowed two-pass
redraw mirroring `widgets.c`'s `scrollback_measure()`/
`widget_scrollback_draw()` (same windowing algorithm, `vga_rows()`/
new `vga_cols()` instead of pixels), and print the status line with NO
trailing `\n` so the physical cursor lands right after it instead of a
row below -- is the general pattern any future full-screen CLI
renderer in this codebase should copy, not another one-off dump. See
`editor.c`'s `editor_render()` top comment and CHANGELOG.md's **Build
379** for the full story, including a padding-math bug the windowing
itself caught during testing.

## Timezone city list is a database file, not a hardcoded array or a config key

`/etc/timezones` (a CSV-style `name,offset_minutes,dst_rule` list,
auto-seeded on first boot) and `/etc/toyos.conf`'s `timezone=<city>`
key are deliberately two different files, not one -- the database
(every city this build knows about) and the selection (which one is
active) change for different reasons and at different rates, so they
went through `etc_config.c`'s generic engine (selection) and a
purpose-built small parser (database) respectively rather than forcing
both into `toyos.conf`. This is also the concrete case **Build 357**'s
"a setting with enough keys of its own gets its own file" escape hatch
was written for -- a city list doesn't fit `key=value` shape at all.
Editing the database only takes effect on the next boot (no live-
reload command yet); see CHANGELOG.md's **Build 367** for the full
writeup and what was verified.

## Build-number scheme: fix/feature/major tiers, not dates or semver

Replaced an earlier date-plus-same-day-counter scheme
(`YYYY.MM.DD.N`), which itself replaced a hand-bumped `0.1.0`-style
semver. `tools/bump_build.sh <fix|feature|major>` is a deliberately
coarse, Windows-build-number-style approximation (+1/+10/+50) chosen
for being consistent and easy to sanity-check later, over a freeform
number that would be more nuanced but less predictable. See
CHANGELOG.md's **Build 110** (the switch itself) and **Build 121**
(the git tag + GitHub Release convention added on top of it), and
CLAUDE.md's own bullet on this for the day-to-day mechanics.

## Socket fds: scaffolding ahead of the driver, not a working transport

`SYS_SOCKET`/`SYS_SEND`/`SYS_RECV` (build 420) exist and are reachable,
but `SYS_SEND`/`SYS_RECV` always return -1 -- there's no NIC driver or
protocol stack for them to move bytes through yet (see README.md's
"Basic TCP/IP networking": PCI enumeration, IRQ registration, and
contiguous memory are done; the driver itself isn't). Building even a
minimal in-kernel loopback transport (two processes exchanging bytes
through a shared buffer, no real network) was considered and
deliberately not taken -- it would prove the syscalls can move data,
but not the actual thing this scaffolding needs to prove: that the fd
namespace, the syscall ABI, and the tagged fd table (`FD_KIND_FILE`/
`FD_KIND_SOCKET` in `syscall.c`) are right, ahead of a real driver
existing. `sockettest` verifies exactly that surface -- fd allocation,
kind separation (`SYS_WRITE`/`SYS_READ` correctly reject a socket fd),
and cleanup -- without pretending a transport exists. See
`syscall_abi.h`'s `SYS_SOCKET` doc comment and CHANGELOG.md's
**Build 420** for the full writeup.
